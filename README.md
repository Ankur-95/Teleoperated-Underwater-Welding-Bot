# Teleoperated-Underwater-Welding-Bot
Teleoperated Underwater Welding ROV designed for SMAW-based marine infrastructure repair with automated electrode handling and precision stabilization.
This project presents the design and development of a teleoperated underwater robotic system capable of performing Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW) in submerged environments. The system was developed to eliminate the safety risks and high operational costs associated with traditional diver-based underwater welding used in marine infrastructure maintenance.

The robot functions as a tethered Remotely Operated Vehicle integrated with an automated Shielded Metal Arc Welding module, enabling precise, controlled welding in low-visibility and hazardous underwater conditions.
